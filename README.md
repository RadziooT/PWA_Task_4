## About the Project

**Bitcoin Buddy** is a progressive web app developed as part of the **Mobile Systems** course. The main objective was to explore core concepts of mobile-friendly, offline-capable applications **without using any modern frontend frameworks**.

Key requirements included:

- Implementing at least **three distinct views**
- Integrating an **external API**
- Creating a **form with data persistence via IndexedDB**
- Adding **custom icons** and a configured `manifest.json` for PWA functionality

---

## Framework Restrictions
This project was built entirely with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** â€” **no frameworks** such as React, Angular, or Vue were used. This constraint was essential to demonstrate understanding of native web APIs and performance-conscious design.

---

## Hosting & Storage
- **Hosted on:** [GitHub Pages](https://radzioot.github.io/PWA_Task_4/)
- **Local storage:** Data is stored in **IndexedDB** to support offline usage.
---

## External API Integration
App uses [Sample APIs](https://sampleapis.com) to simulate real-time **Bitcoin value data**.

- In **online mode**, all views, including the analytics page, function as expected.
- In **offline mode**, the analytics view is replaced with an **error component** to gracefully handle the lack of data.

---
